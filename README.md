# Proposal to Ban YAGPDB.xyz from the No Text To Speech Discord Server

## Introduction
This document outlines the reasons for banning **yagpdb.xyz** (Yet Another General Purpose Discord Bot) from the **No Text To Speech** Discord server. The primary concern is the bot's current performance, particularly its tendency to mute users excessively, which disrupts the intended atmosphere of our community.

## Main Reasons for the Ban

### 1. **Excessive Muting**
YAGPDB has a problematic feature where it frequently mutes users, often without clear reasons or warnings. This can lead to frustration and confusion among members who wish to engage in conversation. The server's purpose is to foster open dialogue, and excessive muting undermines that goal.

### 2. **User Experience**
The frequent mutes create a negative user experience, making members feel silenced and discouraged from participating in discussions. This goes against the core values of the **No Text To Speech** community, which is centered around communication and interaction.

### 3. **Inconsistent Behavior**
The bot’s unpredictable muting behavior can lead to a lack of trust in the moderation process. Members may question why they are being muted and whether it’s being handled fairly, which can lead to conflicts within the community.

### 4. **Disruption of Community Engagement**
An essential aspect of our server is the ability to share thoughts and ideas freely. YAGPDB’s muting feature disrupts this engagement and creates a less welcoming environment for new members.

## Conclusion
Given the excessive muting issues and the negative impact on user experience, banning **yagpdb.xyz** from the **No Text To Speech** Discord server is essential for maintaining a friendly and open community.
